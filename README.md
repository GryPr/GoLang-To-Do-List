# GoLang To-Do-List

## What is this?
This is a simple to-do list web app backend. It implements a REST API with CRUD functions to handle PostgreSQL database changes.

## Frontend
An Angular Frontend is currently being developed for this backend. The Github repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/GryPr/GoToDo-Angular-Frontend)

## To-do
* Authentication of users
* Tree-structure to-do list

## Future plans
This project will be paired with a website frontend which will allow users to manage their to-do list.

## Dependencies

* [Gorilla/Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
* [GORM](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm)
* [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
